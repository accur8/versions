* when doing a cross project build to share the same build number


* turn off generation of build info and only turn it on for published builds



notes:

* handle different organizations per repo
    * will be needed for AHS

* interesting settings

    * cwd for run




Done:

    0) turn off git related stuff if we aren't in a git repo

    1) generate project files

      * elegantly handle js projects (need to auto add scalajs)
      * create a common that supports scalajs and jsProject() and crossProject()

    * version stamp working when not a git repo - we just hardcode the version to 1.0-SNAPSHOT


    * provide a way to override settings

      *
        .enablePlugins(WorkbenchPlugin)
          .settings(
            workbenchDefaultRootObject := Some(("client/manna/default.html", ".")),
            localUrl := ("localhost", 8000),
            workbenchStartMode := WorkbenchStartModes.Manual,
          )
